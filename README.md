Electricity department report
     In this report, we will mention everything that was done in the robotic hand project. We worked on this project on three main tasks:
1. Connect 5 motors to the Arduino board.
2. Write a code to move the motors at an angle of 90 degrees.
3. Addition of variable resistance.

•	Steps:
1. Connecting the power and ground inputs of each motor to an external power supply.

2. Connect the signal input of each motor to its input on the Arduino board (PWM).

3. Code programming to operate the motors and move them at an angle of 90 degrees.

5. A sixth motor was added at the request of the mechanical engineer.

6. Adding a variable resistance. And simulated work to test the validity of the work (Proteus).
